In this case study, we devise and optimize a model for DHL Supply Chain's shipment network, coming to a set of recommendations to minimize CO2 emissions within order demands. Upon additional research, our team analyzed the changes occurring with a potential CNY 3.3 billion budget. Furthermore, we have studied multiple ways in which modified demands, environmentally friendly shipping methods, and cheaper transportation/production costs can further minimize CO2 emissions.
