The feral cat population has increased over the years with a current population ranging to 60 million to 160 million cats. This huge feral cat population brings many environmental and economic consequences. Their hunting damages our wildlife ecosystem and costs the United States billions of dollars each year. Additionally, as the population grows, deadly diseases spread easily among the feral community, harming more cats and other stray animals. While there are currently non-profit animal shelters and organizations that aim to rescue feral cats, we wonder if there is an optimal economic policy to manage this growing population.
